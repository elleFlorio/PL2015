-- We want to provide a function that computes the performance of a footbal player.
-- Starting from the number of matches he played and the number of goals 
-- he made (goals / matches),
-- we decide if it's a good player or not

-- typeclass
-- implementation example (from the Prelude:)
-- class Eq a where
--     (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
--     (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
--     x == y = not (x /= y)

-- This means that a) we have to implement both "equals" and "not equals"
-- and b) since "x is equal to y if x is not equal to y" and viceversa,
-- we can just define "equals" or "not equals" and Haskell will infer the
-- other one.
